# HarmonyAI - Version 3

## Overview
Version 3 of HarmonyAI introduces significant improvements in tokenization and the graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance user experience and response accuracy.

### Key Improvements

#### 1. Enhanced Tokenization
- The tokenization algorithm has been improved to:
  - Search for partial matches within sentences rather than requiring an exact match.
  - Deliver more accurate responses by identifying and understanding relevant parts of the input.
- This enhancement makes the chatbot more robust and better equipped to handle diverse user inputs.

#### 2. Updated GUI
- The graphical user interface (GUI) has been upgraded to:
  - Provide a more visually appealing and intuitive design.
  - Display tokens being processed, offering transparency in how the chatbot interprets user input.
  - Include an enhanced chat display for smoother user interactions.
