# HarmonyBot - Mental Health Chatbot with Sentiment Analysis

HarmonyBot is an NLP-powered Mental Health Chatbot designed to support and guide individuals seeking emotional and psychological well-being. The bot engages in meaningful conversations, performs sentiment analysis on user inputs, and learns from user interactions to improve its responses over time.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat:** Engage in a conversation with the chatbot using a text-based interface.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzes user input to detect sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) using TextBlob for more empathetic responses.
- **Knowledge Base Management:** Dynamically loads, updates, and saves responses to user queries using a JSON-based knowledge base.
- **Learning Capability:** The bot can learn new questions and answers based on user feedback.
- **GUI Integration:** Tkinter-based graphical user interface for a more accessible interaction experience.
